# naturalLanguageProcessing
In this lab I are introduced to coding with heaps and hash tables. I am first asked to draw a heap using an StdDraw.java file correctly
basing the code off the draw_tree method that I have been using before for binary search tree.
I am asked to do some to create a simplified version of this system that can understand human languages in written and spoken forms.
Use the word embeddings to see in such a way that if two words are used in similar contexts and how.
With the file provided to us I are to see how the words are used in a similar context and provide extra information regarding
the use of these words.
